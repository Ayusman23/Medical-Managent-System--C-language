# Hospital Management System

A fully functional, terminal-based **Hospital Management System (HMS)** written in **pure C (C99)** with **binary file I/O** for persistent data storage, now featuring a **Modern Web UI Dashboard**!

---

## 🌟 NEW: Modern Web UI Dashboard

We have added a stunning, fully dynamic Web UI that seamlessly bridges to the C backend! You can now use a beautiful web browser interface to manage Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Wards, and Billing while retaining the lightning-fast C binary `.dat` storage. 

### How to use the Web UI:
1. Make sure you have **Python** installed.
2. Double click the **`start_ui.bat`** file, or run:
   ```powershell
   .\start_ui.bat
   ```
3. The server will start and the dashboard will automatically open in your default browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## 🔐 Default Login Credentials

| Role  | Username | Password   |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Admin | `admin`  | `admin123` |
| Staff | `staff`  | `staff123` |

> **Admin** has full access to all menus including User Registration, Dashboard, and About.  
> **Staff** has limited access (no add/remove staff, no user registration).

## 🏥 Complete Setup & Example Workflow
**To experience the system as a true full-stack Medical Management Application, follow this "Day in the Life" setup:**

1. **Initial Infrastructure Setup**
   - Log in as **Admin** (`admin` / `admin123`).
   - Navigate to `[2] Doctor Management` -> Add your doctors (e.g., General Surgeon). Take note of their given Doctor IDs.
   - Navigate to `[5] Ward / Bed Management` -> Create some wards (e.g., ICU with 10 beds, General with 20 beds).

2. **Register a Walk-in Patient**
   - Head to `[1] Patient Management` -> `[1] Add Patient`.
   - The system automatically assigns a Patient ID.

3. **The Patient Journey: Booking & Admission**
   - Go to `[3] Appointment Scheduling` -> `[1] Book Appointment` linking the Patient ID and Doctor ID.
   - If the doctor orders an operation, go to `[5] Ward / Bed Management` -> `[2] Admit Patient to Ward`. This actively assigns them a bed, which will show up immediately across the system.

4. **Discharge & Billing Checkout**
   - Once recovered, navigate to `[1] Patient Management` -> `[7] Discharge Patient`.
   - Head to the cashier at `[4] Billing & Invoices` -> `[1] Generate Bill`. The system dynamically detects their recent ward admission and alerts you to manually add room charges.
   - Proceed to `[3] Mark Bill as Paid` once they settle the invoice.

5. **End-of-Day Review**
   - Head to `[8] Dashboard` (Admin only) to watch real-time synchronised tallies of the SQLite-like binary databases counting active patients, doctors, generated bills, and occupied beds.

## 📝 Notes

- All `*.dat` files are created automatically on first run inside `database/`.
- There are **no external dependencies** — only the C standard library.
- Tested with GCC 12+ on Windows (MinGW-w64) and Ubuntu 22.04.
